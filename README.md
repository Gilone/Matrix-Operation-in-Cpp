# Matrix-Operation-in-Cpp

This is a high-performance, portable linear algebra library for a client who has an awful case of not-invented-here syndrome. As a start, the client has asked for just transpose and multiplication of MxN matrices.

 The correctness of your solution is demonstrated by writing tests. 

Your solution should be implemented in standard C++11 (g++ or clang++ on Linux). To keep things simple, the library may be header-only. You must include a Makefile/CMakeLists.txt, or you must specify the compiler command used to compile your source file: g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -lthread
